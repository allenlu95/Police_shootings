# Projectstest
This is my first Data analysis project done in python.
For the project I used two data sets: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/police-killings and https://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/asrh/2015/SCPRC-EST2015-18+POP-RES.html
I will go back on this particular project in the future and analyze information on age and gender as well as create a choropleth map with matplotlib.
