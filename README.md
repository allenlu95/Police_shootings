# Projectstest
This is my first Data analysis project done in python.
For the project I used two data sets: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/police-killings and  http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmkl
All full analysis can be found in the police analysis.docx found in the files above
#Future updates
I will go back on this particular project in the future and analyze information on age and gender as well as create a choropleth map with matplotlib.
